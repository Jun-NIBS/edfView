@Tools->Import Annotations/events:

If one imports such lines

> # Onset,Duration,Annotation
> 2014-07-21T21:57:02.9930000,,test

The duration column should be set to column 2 I guess, but the duration is not
correctly read because the event was saved without duration.

###

@annotations_dock.cpp->UI_Annotationswindow::annotation_selected:

the line

> annotation = edfplus_annotation_item(&mainwindow->annotationlist[file_num], n);

seems to give a segmentation fault when trying to select the last one in a list
of annotations.  Funny enough, the function is used at elsewhere and works
fine.  The workaround is a manual, sequential re-iteration of the linear list
search, instead of calling that function.  However, something is fishy.

###

Hilfslinien have to be drawn to distinguish amplitude variations above
threshold, for example in Delta waves.

###

Epoch annotation should be shown somewhere in the figure.
